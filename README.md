Updated OpenConsole.exe with screen tearing fix
Replace the conhost.exe exectutable in your System32 directory with the OpenConsole.exe. Rename it to conhost.exe first. This should fix the screen tearing issue which happens with AutoHotKey.

First take ownership of System32 then use the install batchfile or drag it there yourself...
